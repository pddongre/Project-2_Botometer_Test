# Botometer_Test

This is a test code that uses Botometer to check the activity of Twitter accounts. 
It gives them a score based on how likely they are to be bots. Higher the score more probability of those accounts being bot-like.

  3.astroturf: manually labeled political bots and accounts involved in follow trains that systematically delete content
  4. spammer: accounts labeled as spambots from several datasets
  5.financialâ€©: bots that post using cashtags
  6.other: miscellaneous other bots obtained from manual annotation, user feedback, etc.
